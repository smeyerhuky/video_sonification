# Music Synthesizer Favicon Design

## Design Concept
The favicon for our video sonification application should represent the core functionality of audio synthesis while being recognizable at small sizes. The design will replace the current React logo with a music synthesizer-themed icon.

## Design Elements
1. **Waveform Representation**:
   - Include multiple waveform types (sine, sawtooth, square) to represent different synthesis methods
   - Position waveforms centrally in the design for immediate recognition

2. **Control Elements**:
   - Add simplified knob/dial representations to evoke synthesizer interfaces
   - Include minimal fader/slider elements if space permits

3. **Color Palette**:
   - Primary: Vibrant purple (#8A2BE2) - associated with creativity and electronic music
   - Secondary: Electric blue (#00BFFF) - for contrast and energy
   - Accent: Bright yellow (#FFD700) - for highlights and focus points

4. **Technical Specifications**:
   - Maintain similar dimensions to current React SVG (approximately 36×32)
   - Preserve the viewBox settings for proper scaling
   - Include appropriate aria attributes for accessibility

## Implementation Notes
- The design should be simple enough to be recognizable at 16×16px (standard favicon size)
- Use minimal path elements to ensure clean scaling
- Avoid overly detailed elements that would be lost at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility against both light and dark backgrounds

This favicon will serve as a visual identifier for our application, reinforcing its focus on audio synthesis and music creation through visual elements.
