## Technical Components

### 1. Multi-Band Motion Analysis Framework

The Multi-Band Motion Analysis Framework decomposes motion in video into frequency bands and motion types, creating rich distributions that serve as the foundation for audio parameter mapping.

#### A. Frequency Band Decomposition

Motion is analyzed across five distinct frequency bands:

1. **Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF)**: 0.01-0.1 Hz
   - Scene transitions, camera movements, slow evolutions
   - Maps to: arrangement structure, long-form musical evolution

2. **Low Frequency (LF)**: 0.1-1 Hz
   - Walking, swaying (corn in field), gentle repetitive motion
   - Maps to: bass fundamentals, filter envelope timing

3. **Mid Frequency (MF)**: 1-5 Hz
   - Running, dancing, regular activities
   - Maps to: wobble LFO rates, rhythm foundations

4. **High Frequency (HF)**: 5-15 Hz
